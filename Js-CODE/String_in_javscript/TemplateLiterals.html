    //  TEMPLATE LITERALS IN JAVASCRIPT 
    // Template Literals is nothing but it is a another way to write string in javascript.
    //Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:
     let str= "Anurag roy";
     let str2=`Anurag roy`;
     document.write(str,"<br>");
     document.write(str2,"<br>");

                // Benifit of back-ticks (``)

    //1. We can use single and double quotes inside a string
      let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;
      document.write(text,"<br>");

    //2. we can write  multiline strings:
      let str3=`hello anurag
      how are you
      i am fine what about you
      nice  to meet you `
      document.write(str3,"<br>");

    // We can also print variable with string
     // Normaly we do that if we print variable with string
      let item="pen";
      let price=20;
      document.write("The cost of ",item,"is ",price,"<br>");// Normal Way
      document.write(`The cost of ${item} is  ${price} `);// Template literals

    // String Interpolation:
    /*Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.
      The method is called string interpolation.*/
    let car= "BMW";
    let Cost=1000000;
    let A,B,Total;
    A=20;
    B=30;
    document.write(`The price of ${car} is ${Cost} Rupes <br>`)
    document.write(`Sum of A + B is ${A+B}`)
